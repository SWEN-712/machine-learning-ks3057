Be like Tom. Be flexible, adaptable and accessible. People with disabilities want your business! And with a sniff of #accessibility and inclusion - you will meet some really cool folks (if I say so myself). 

Anyone needs an awesome plumber in Seattle area, let me know :) The End
Tom fixed the issue in under an hour, stopped the mini flood and taught me a bunch about water heaters. Turns out one of his daughters knows sign language and he didn’t think twice when I asked to text rather than call. He made my day! 
/7
Instant message back from one “ok great, my number is xx.. I’m sure we can work this through with texting”. 

Two hours later he arrived.. meet Tom! 
6/ https://t.co/dZ9NSDDXdN
Three responses before the kettles stopped boiling. Messages from them all. Squee. I reply to them all, saying “My number is xxx - text is best, I’m deaf (and British, but the deaf part is the most relevant :))”
5/
Wait an hour. Clean out garage and direct the mini flood to the outside. Check my phone. Nothing. 

Plan B. I search again and find an app called @thumbtack. Downloaded it and popped in the details and request for emergency plumber. 

Make a cuppa tea. 

4/
I start calling. If you hold the phone right you can tell when it rings, or a voicemail/IVR kicks in. I left voicemails on three lines and spoke ‘at’ one human explaining the problem and asking them to text or email me in return.. 3/
Easier than I thought. Found several. Most with weekend and emergency 24/7 service. Whoop. 

Then realize that to request you have to call. 

Im deaf. 

2/
It’s the simple things that matter. Woke up to a leak in water heater and flooded garage.. something always goes bang over the holidays in our house. Husband takes kids to appointments and I set to work finding a plumber on a Saturday.. 1/
